# CS Final Project 
This is my personal version of the final project for "Introduction to Computers and Programming" (Fall 2024).  
The original project was co-developed with a teammate.

## My Contributions
- **Algorithm Design**: Developed and optimized the core routing algorithm for network pathfinding.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved algorithm efficiency and reduced computation time for large datasets.
- **Testing**: Implemented unit tests for the algorithm to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Project Description
In chip design, the routing problem involves finding paths to connect circuit
components on a chip while avoiding obstacles. Leeâ€™s Algorithm is a classic
method for routing on a grid, and it guarantees a shortest path.
Design a program to find the shortest path on a 2D grid (M by N) from a
starting point (source) to an endpoint (sink) while avoiding all obstacles (blocks).
